----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Requirements to be completed

(*)Data sharing: create a shared preference for clientId, invoiceId and serviceId[not implemented] (to remove the complexity of creating and passing variables to and from acticities. Instead just set them in the preferences.
		-->Need to make sure that multiple instances of sharedpreferences can be used at once
		-->If not, then additional 'fields' need to be added to the SPAdapter to accommodate email, invoices to display, etc...
		
(*)Determine the best way to insert new invoices into the table
		-->Trying to add a hidden textview on the spinner so that each name of the service is mapped to the service Id as well.
		-->Add the service id into the invoice row, so that information from that service can be queried later if need be.
		-->Need to separate how id is added for services vs customers.
	( )Create a good method for keeping track of how many services and for what price (reporting)
			-->This is tied to the objective above... There needs to be a good way to search the db and parse for the number of services/goods
		   		in an effective manner to be used for reporting.
		   
( )Settings activity (email, time for notification, number of invoices to display, etc...)
		-->Currently in progress
		
	( )Import/Export capabilites
			-->Accessed via settings 
( )Create an edit view for specific invoices
